my name is aaron parisi
i am studying to become a web developer
the jury's out on whether or not i'll really dig it
but it's something to do for now and it's not a life sentence
at the end of the day, i enjoy pontificating about what i like a lot
and so i really don't want to decide anything,
i just want to think about deciding
so here i am, doing something for the time being.
